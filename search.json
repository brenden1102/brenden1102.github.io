    "title": "The Improbable Turnaround of the 2019 St. Louis Blues",
    "section": "",
    "text": "On Jan. 3, 2019 The St Louis Blues found themselves in last place in the NHL and were consistently losing games by a wide margin. Fans were beginning to check out. Tickets for late season home games at the time could be found for 15 dollars or less on the resale market. However, the team ended up pulling off one of the most incredible turnarounds in sports history. So, what happened? On Nov 9, The Blues fired their head coach, Mike Yeo, after a 2-0 loss to the LA Kings who at the time were the only team with fewer points than them. The team promoted assistant coach Craig Berube to interim head coach. By early January the Blues had fallen to last place in the league having played almost 50% of their schedule. This is when St. Louis began to climb out of the league’s basement. Lucky enough for the Blues, many of the teams ahead of them in the Western Conference were struggling. By the all-star break they were only 3 points out of a wild card spot. From Jan. 20, through Feb. 11, St. Louis won 11 games in a row and the playoffs were looking like a possibility again.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(fastRhockey)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(ggimage)\n\nNhlLogos &lt;- read_csv(\"nhl_logos.csv\") \nHockeyLogs19 &lt;- read_csv(\"hockeylogs2019.csv\") |&gt; \n  mutate(month = floor_date(date, \"month\")) \nGoalieStats19 &lt;- read_csv(\"NHL 2018-19 Goalie Stats.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(GS &gt;= 30) |&gt; \n  filter(SO &gt;0)\nGoalieShutouts &lt;- GoalieStats19 |&gt; \n  filter(SO &gt;= 4)\nGoodGAA &lt;- GoalieStats19 |&gt; \n  filter(GAA &lt;= 2.48)\nJordanB &lt;- GoalieStats19 |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Jordan Binnington\") \nHhlShots &lt;- HockeyLogs19 |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  filter(team_name!=\"St. Louis Blues\") |&gt; \n  summarise(Shots_For = sum(ff/82),\n            Shots_against = sum(fa/82),\n            Winz = sum(x_2 == \"W\")) |&gt; \n  left_join(NhlLogos, by=c(\"team_name\"=\"espn_team_name\"))\nBluezShotztoJan &lt;-  HockeyLogs19 |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  filter(team_name == \"St. Louis Blues\", date &lt; as.Date(\"2019-01-03\")) |&gt; \n  summarise(Games = n(), \n            Winz = sum(x_2 == \"W\"), \n            ff = sum(ff), \n            fa = sum(fa)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Shots_For = ff/Games,\n            Shots_against = fa/Games) |&gt; \n  left_join(NhlLogos, by=c(\"team_name\"=\"espn_team_name\"))\nBluezShotzaftJan &lt;-  HockeyLogs19 |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name) |&gt; \n  filter(team_name == \"St. Louis Blues\", date &gt;= as.Date(\"2019-01-03\")) |&gt; \n  summarise(Games = n(), \n            Winz = sum(x_2 == \"W\"), \n            ff = sum(ff), \n            fa = sum(fa)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Shots_For = ff/Games,\n            Shots_against = fa/Games) |&gt; \n  left_join(NhlLogos, by=c(\"team_name\"=\"espn_team_name\"))\n\nPlayoffTeams &lt;- c(\"Tampa Bay Lightning\", \"Boston Bruins\", \"Dallas Stars\", \"Columbus Blue Jackets\", \"St. Louis Blues\", \"Colorado Avalanche\", \"Nashville Predators\", \"Calgary Flames\", \"Carolina Hurricanes\", \"San Jose Sharks\", \"New York Islanders\", \"Washington Capitals\", \"Toronto Maple Leafs\", \"Pittsburgh Penguins\", \"Winnipeg Jets\", \"Vegas Golden Knights\")\n\nMonthlyRecord &lt;- HockeyLogs19 |&gt; \n  group_by(team_name, month) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Wins = sum(x_2 == \"W\"),\n    Losses = sum(x_2 == \"L\")\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    CumulativeWins = cumsum(Wins),\n    CumulativeLosses = cumsum(Losses)    \n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(team_name %in% PlayoffTeams) \n\nStl &lt;- MonthlyRecord |&gt;\n  filter(team_name == \"St. Louis Blues\")\nTbl &lt;- MonthlyRecord |&gt; \n  filter(team_name == \"Tampa Bay Lightning\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_rect(aes(xmin=as.Date(\"2019-01-23\"), xmax=as.Date(\"2019-02-21\"), ymin=0, ymax=60), fill=\"#E41C38\", alpha=.2) +\n  geom_line(data=MonthlyRecord, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=MonthlyRecord, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_line(data=Stl, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"#002F87\") +\n  geom_point(data=Stl, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"#002F87\") +\n  geom_line(data=Tbl, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_point(data=Tbl, aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins, group=team_name), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2018-11-19\"), linetype= \"dashed\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2019-01-07\"), linetype= \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2018-12-08\"), y=65, label=\"Mike Yeo Fired\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2019-02-11\"), y=65, label=\"Jordan Binnington First Start\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2019-03-20\"), y=20, label=\"11 game win streak\"), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  scale_x_date(limits=c(as.Date(\"2018-10-01\"),as.Date(\"2019-05-01\"))) +\n  geom_text(data=Tbl |&gt; filter(month == max(month)), aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins-3, group=team_name, label=team_name)) + \n  geom_text(data=Stl |&gt; filter(month == max(month)), aes(x=month, y=CumulativeWins-3, group=team_name, label=team_name)) + \n\n  labs(title=\"From Irrelevant to Relevant\", subtitle=\"The Blues were in last place in the NHL as late as January of 2019. \", x=\"Month\", y=\"Wins\", caption = \"Source: Hockey Reference | By Brenden Evers\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the credit for the Blues climb back to relevance can be attributed to the success of rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington. In just over 30 regular season starts Binnington posted strong numbers including five shutouts. Binnington also finished the season atop the goals against leader board. The five shutouts are pretty impressive considering Sergei Bobrovsky and Marc-André Fleury both had more twice as many starts as Binnington.\n\n\nCode\nBar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n   geom_bar(data=GoodGAA, aes(x=reorder(Player, -GAA), weight=GAA), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=JordanB, aes(x=reorder(Player, -GAA), weight=GAA), fill = \"#002868\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Goals Against Average\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n  \nBar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=GoalieShutouts, aes(x=reorder(Player, SO), weight=SO), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=JordanB, aes(x=reorder(Player, SO), weight=SO), fill = \"#002868\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Shutouts\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\nBar1 + Bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Good Goaltending Might Help\",\n    subtitle = \"Despite only starting 30 games Jordan Binnington was top 10 in shutouts and allowed the least goals per game.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Hockey Reference | By Brenden Evers\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Blues also stepped it up on both defense and offense. From Jan. 3 to the end of the season St. Louis averaged 6 more shots or shot attempts per game and averaged one less shot against per game. With improved goaltending and more chances to score the Blues went on an incredible run just to make it to the postseason where they won their first championship in franchise history.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=HhlShots, aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=BluezShotztoJan, aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against), color=\"#002868\")+\n  geom_point(data=BluezShotzaftJan, aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against), color=\"#002868\")+\n  geom_image(data=BluezShotzaftJan,aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against, image = espn_logo), asp = 16/9, size = 0.07) +\n  geom_image(data=BluezShotztoJan,aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against, image = espn_logo), asp = 16/9, size = 0.07)+\n   geom_text(aes(x=40.0, y=34.0, label=\"Lots of shots attempted\"), color=\"darkgrey\", alpha=.8) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=34.0, y=40, label=\"Lots of shots alowed\"), color=\"darkgrey\", alpha=.8) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=34.2, y=34.5, label=\"STL Before January 3\"), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=39.0, y=33.6, label=\"STL After January 3\"), color=\"#002868\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(HhlShots$Shots_For), linetype= \"dashed\")+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(HhlShots$Shots_against), linetype= \"dashed\")+\n  scale_y_reverse()+\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=HhlShots, \n    aes(x=Shots_For, y=Shots_against, label=refe_abrName)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Shots Taken\", \n    y=\"Shots Alowed\", \n    title=\"St. Louis Shot The Puck More\",\n    subtitle=\"The Blues averaged six more shots taken and one less shot allowed after January 3.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Hockey Reference | By: Brenden Evers\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )"

    "text": "Over the last three seasons, The Chicago Cubs have been in the upper half of Major League Baseball’s payroll. Yet, the team has seemed to struggle with pitching. Over the last three seasons the north side has not ranked higher than 14 in team ERA. In 2021 in fact, Chicago ranked in the bottom 4 of the league in team ERA. So what is the cause of these struggles? Teams throw the four seam fastball around half the time so naturally teams would want to be good at throwing the fastball. There are two aspects to a good fastball. How hard the pitch was thrown and how much it moved on the way to the plate. A good stat when looking at how much a pitch moved is active spin rate. It’s listed as a percentage, the closer to 100% the better. Meaning if a pitcher throws a fastball with 98% active spin, 98% of the spin is attributing to movement of the pitch. So where do the Cubs rank over the last season in velocity and spin rate?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nPitchData23 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2023.csv\") \nPitchData22 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2022.csv\") \nPitchData21 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2021.csv\") \nStrikeout &lt;- read_csv(\"stats.csv\")\nVelo &lt;- read_csv(\"PitchVelo.csv\")\nGBandHH &lt;- read_csv(\"GBdata.csv\")\nPitchData3yrs &lt;- bind_rows(PitchData23, PitchData22, PitchData21) |&gt;\n  select(Pitcher, Team, Fourseam, Slider, Curve, Season)\n\nAdvPitch23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023 Advanced pitching data\") |&gt;

It certainly doesn’t help their velocity case when Kyle Hendricks goes out there throwing 86 mph every five days. However, a pitcher like Hendricks doesn’t make his living by throwing the fastball. Hendricks lives on getting weak contact or strikeouts from breaking pitches. When looking at curve balls and sliders the story is not quite as bad.\n\n\nCode\nBar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=NationalCurve, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=CubsTeamCB, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"#0E3386\") +\n\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Curveball Active Spin Rate\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n  \nBar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=NationalSlider, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=CubsTeamSL, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"#0E3386\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Slider Active Spin Rate\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\nBar1 + Bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Cubs throw the breaking ball significantly better\",\n    subtitle = \"Chicago is top 6 in the National League among sliders and curveballs.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Baseball Savant | By Brenden Evers\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean? The Cubs have problems throwing the fastball but throw their breaking pitches better than average. Good breaking pitches as noted above get hit softly on the ground or induce a strikeout, but a bad fastball usually gets hit hard.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=AdvWins, aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, size=W), alpha =.2) +\n   geom_point(data=CubsAdvWins, aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, size=W),color = \"#0E3386\") +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(AdvWins$`HardH%`), linetype= \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(AdvWins$`GB%`), linetype= \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CubsAdvWins, \n    aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, label=TmSeason)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Ground Ball Percentage\",\n    y=\"Hard Hit Percentage\",\n    title=\"The Cubs are near average in opposing batter contact\",\n    subtitle=\"The northside's breaking pitches have led to more ground balls than average.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Brenden Evers\")  + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs have been an average or slightly below average team over the last three seasons in wins and losses. Their pitching has been no different. There has been some improvement. The pitching staff is not getting hit as hard and the defense has been upgraded. In 2023 the Cubs finished with a top 10 defense in the league. With a new manager coming in, and general manager who seems motivated to bring playoff baseball back to the north side of Chicago. These remaining issues might be addressed soon."
