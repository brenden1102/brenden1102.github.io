    "text": "Over the last three seasons, The Chicago Cubs have been in the upper half of Major League Baseball’s payroll. Yet, the team has seemed to struggle with pitching. Over the last three seasons the north side has not ranked higher than 14 in team ERA. In 2021 in fact, Chicago ranked in the bottom 4 of the league in team ERA. So what is the cause of these struggles? Teams throw the four seam fastball around half the time so natuarly teams would want to be good at throwing the fastball. There are two aspects to a good fastball. How hard the pitch was thrown and how much it moved on the way to the plate. A good stat when looking at how much a pitch moved is active spin rate. It’s listed as a percentage, the closer to 100% the better. Meaning if a pitcher throws a fastball with 98% active spin, 98% of the spin is attributing to movement of the pitch. So where do the Cubs rank over the last season in velocity and spin rate?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nPitchData23 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2023.csv\") \nPitchData22 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2022.csv\") \nPitchData21 &lt;- read_csv(\"pitches - 2021.csv\") \nStrikeout &lt;- read_csv(\"stats.csv\")\nVelo &lt;- read_csv(\"PitchVelo.csv\")\nGBandHH &lt;- read_csv(\"GBdata.csv\")\nPitchData3yrs &lt;- bind_rows(PitchData23, PitchData22, PitchData21) |&gt;\n  select(Pitcher, Team, Fourseam, Slider, Curve, Season)\n\nAdvPitch23 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023 Advanced pitching data\") |&gt;

It certainly doesn’t help their velocity case when Kyle Hendricks goes out there throwing 86 mph every five days. However, a pitcher like Hendricks doesn’t make his living by throwing the fastball. Hendricks lives on getting weak contact or strikeouts from breaking pitches. When looking at curve balls and sliders the story is not quite as bad.\n\n\nCode\nBar1 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=NationalCurve, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=CubsTeamCB, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"#0E3386\") +\n\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Curveball Active Spin Rate\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n  \nBar2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data=NationalSlider, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"grey\") +\n   geom_bar(data=CubsTeamSL, aes(x=reorder(Team, SpinRate), weight=SpinRate), fill = \"#0E3386\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Slider Active Spin Rate\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\nBar1 + Bar2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"The Cubs throw the breaking ball significantly better\",\n    subtitle = \"Chicago is top 6 in the National League among sliders and curveballs.\",\n    caption = \"Source: Baseball Savant | By Brenden Evers\"\n  )  & \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what does this all mean? The Cubs have problems throwing the fastball but throw their breaking pitches better than average. Good breaking pitches as noted above get hit softly on the ground or induce a strikeout, but a bad fastball usually gets hit hard.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=AdvWins, aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, size=W), alpha =.2) +\n   geom_point(data=CubsAdvWins, aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, size=W),color = \"#0E3386\") +\n   geom_hline(yintercept = mean(AdvWins$`HardH%`), linetype= \"dashed\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(AdvWins$`GB%`), linetype= \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CubsAdvWins, \n    aes(x=`GB%`, y=`HardH%`, label=TmSeason)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Ground Ball Percentage\",\n    y=\"Hard Hit Percentage\",\n    title=\"The Cubs are near average in opposing batter contact\",\n    subtitle=\"The northside's breaking pitches have led to more ground balls than average.\",\n    caption=\"Source: Baseball Reference | By: Brenden Evers\")  + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs have been an average or slightly below average team over the last three seasons in wins and losses. Their pitching has been no different. There has been some improvement. The pitching staff is not getting hit as hard and the defense has been upgraded. In 2023 the Cubs finished with a top 10 defense in the league. With a new manager coming in, and general manager who seems motivated to bring playoff baseball back to the north side of Chicago. These remaining issues might be addressed soon."
